# Asteroids Deluxe 2023
Atari 1980 arcade Asteroids Deluxe made in raylib 4.5 with Alpha 1.0 of my Knightmare engine that includes vector line models.
This is the best remake I've made of the game yet. All sounds made with LabChirp.
To play, Side Arrows control rotation. Up arrow thrust, down arrow shield. Left CTRL or Space to fire. Enter to start. P key to pause.
If you have an Xbox 360/One controller use Left stick or D-Pad for rotation. A button to fire, B or Right Bumper Button for shields, Right trigger for thrust. Start to start, and Menu to pause.
